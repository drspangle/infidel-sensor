Calibration
-----------
- Flash board with calibration.ino
- Connect a host via I2C (see provided host-example.ino)
- Insert each calibration drill bit shafts and replace the lookup table entries in driver.ino with your own measurements

  * Measure the actual diameter of the shafts and fill second column
  * Use the host's output multiplied by 1000 to fill first column

- Finally, flash driver.ino with your values filled out
- Hub should now output exact diameter values

    Note:
    Analog output is currently not enabled in driver.ino (I2C and FAULT pin only).
    If you need analog output, you can use Infidel_release_ee.ino.
    See :doc:`firmware` for more details.
