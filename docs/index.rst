*A cheap, yet precise filament diameter sensor, intended to compensate for filament diameter deviations in real-time.*

The InFiDEL is a cheap (< $5) filament diameter sensor intended for use with FDM 3d printers.
The sensor can be calibrated to provide surprisingly precise filament diameter readings in real-time.
The main idea is to use the sensor to correct for filament diameter deviations while printing.

Based on this proof-of-concept: https://www.youmagine.com/designs/filament-diameter-sensor
